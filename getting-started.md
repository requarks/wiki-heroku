## Introduce yourself

Attending our meetup for the first time can be overwhelming. We get it. How about we start small? Introduce yourself so we can get to know you better and connect you with the right resources.

Tell us a little about yourself. What's your name? What got you interested in Code for Orlando? What do you do? By any chance, do you have a favorite ice cream flavor? We'd like to know!

Can't make a meetup? Join our Slack community and say hello in the #general chat channel.
